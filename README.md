# book_recommendation
The book recommendation system is designed to suggest books to users based on their age, average rating of books, collaborative filtering, and nearest neighbor algorithms. The system uses the age and average rating of books to recommend books to users that fit their age group and preferred rating range.

## STEPS TO FOLOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN BOOK_RECOMENDATION SYSTEM PROJECT 

## STEP 1 DOWNLOAD THE DATASET 

To use the BX dataset for this project, follow these steps:

The dataset used in this project can be downloaded from [here](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/).


1. Click on each of the following links to download the dataset files:

BX-Books.csv
BX-Book-Ratings.csv
BX-Users.csv

2. Save the files in a folder on your local machine.

Note: These files are provided for research purposes only. Please refer to the website for any additional information or usage guidelines.
Step 1: Gather data
The first step is to obtain the data necessary to build the book recommendation system. In this case, we will use the dataset from http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/, which includes information on books, authors, and user ratings.

## Step 2: open a python
Create a new Python script in your preferred Python environment (e.g. Anaconda, Spyder, IDLE, Visual Studio Code).

## Step 3: Import necessary libraries
In order to run the code successfully, we need to import some necessary libraries. These libraries are:

1. NumPy: a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level 2. mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
3. Pandas: a software library written for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.
4. Seaborn: a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
6. Matplotlib: a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
7. Warnings: a module that implements a simple filter to suppress specific warnings.
8. 
Here is the code to import the necessary libraries:

### Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import warnings

##incase libarary not found
Note: If any of these libraries are not installed on your system, you can use pip to install them. For example, if you need to install seaborn, you can run pip install seaborn in your command prompt or terminal.

## Step 4: Load the data
Load the data from the dataset files (BX-Books.csv, BX-Book-Ratings.csv, BX-Users.csv) into the Jupyter Notebook using pandas.

## Step 5: Data preprocessing
Clean and preprocess the data to ensure that it is ready for analysis. This may involve removing missing values, handling categorical variables, and feature engineering.

## Step 6: Perform exploratory data analysis
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insight into the dataset, including identifying any missing or erroneous data, and visualizing the data.

## Step 7: Build the recommendation system
Use machine learning algorithms to build the recommendation system. This may involve collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or a hybrid approach.
