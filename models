## Collaborative Filtering 
It is a type of recommendation system that predicts a user's preferences by analyzing their past behaviors and the behavior of other users who have similar preferences.
The code provided in the question implements a Collaborative Filtering recommendation system using cosine similarity.


Here are the key points of the Collaborative Filtering code:
1. The dataset used is a book ratings dataset, which contains information about books, users, and ratings.
2.The first step is to set a popularity threshold to filter out books with very few ratings. In this code, the threshold is set to 50 ratings per book.
3.A new dataframe is created that contains only popular books and their ratings.
4.The book ratings are then transformed into a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a book and its ratings given by different users.
5.The DictVectorizer class from scikit-learn is used to convert the list of dictionaries into a sparse matrix.
6.Cosine similarity is calculated between the books using the pairwise_similarity() function from scikit-learn's metrics module.
7.A function called getTopRecommendations() is defined to recommend books to the user based on the input book.
8.The function takes the book's ISBN as input and returns a list of recommended books.
9. The recommended books are determined by finding the books that are most similar to the input book, based on cosine similarity.
